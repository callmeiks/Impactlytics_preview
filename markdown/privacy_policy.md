## 1. Overview

At **Impactlytics**, we are committed to protecting user privacy while conducting responsible and beneficial academic research. This Privacy Policy outlines what data we collect, how we use it, and how we protect the privacy of TikTok users and the TikTok platform.

Impactlytics is developed for **non-commercial educational research** as part of a graduate-level data analytics course. All platform operations, including API usage, are designed to support TikTokâ€™s policies and enhance the platform through safe, low-risk experimentation.

---

## 2. Summary of Principles

- **Minimal Data Use**: We only access what is strictly necessary for academic modeling  
- **User Control**: Users retain ownership of all content and may revoke access at any time  
- **Platform Integrity**: No activity disrupts TikTokâ€™s community, algorithm, or monetization systems  
- **Full Transparency**: We disclose all data usage and request explicit consent before any experiment

---

## 3. Data We Collect

Impactlytics may access **limited, non-sensitive public data** from TikTok users via TikTokâ€™s APIs, only with your permission. This includes:

- TikTok user ID (pseudonymized internally)
- Display name
- Region
- Follower count
- Video performance metrics (e.g., views, likes, shares, watch time)

We **do not collect**:
- Private messages
- Account login credentials
- Email addresses or phone numbers
- Location data beyond publicly available region
- Comments, draft videos, or monetization status

All data access complies with TikTok's **[Developer Terms of Service](https://developers.tiktok.com/terms/)** and **[Community Guidelines](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines)**.

---

## 4. How We Use the Data

The data is used exclusively for:
- Assigning users to experimental cohorts for statistical balance
- Generating and posting pre-approved video content for A/B testing
- Measuring and modeling public engagement outcomes
- Estimating causal relationships between content features and viewer responses

All analyses are conducted at the **aggregate level** to protect anonymity and prevent re-identification.

We do **not**:
- Use your data for advertising or marketing
- Sell or transfer your data to third parties
- Use your data to manipulate engagement algorithms
- Monetize any results or content

---

## 5. TikTok API Use and Safeguards

We use the following TikTok API scopes:

- `user.info.basic`: To access user metadata for cohort grouping  
- `video.upload`: To post videos under randomized experimental conditions

All videos are:
- Reviewed and approved by users before posting
- Compliant with TikTokâ€™s community guidelines
- Intended for non-commercial, research-only purposes

Impactlytics does not alter or interfere with normal TikTok platform functionality.

---

## 6. Data Storage and Security

- All data is stored temporarily in encrypted environments
- Access is restricted to authorized USC student researchers
- Data is fully deleted at the conclusion of the research project (July 2025)

No persistent identifiers are retained. Any published results are de-identified and presented in statistical summary form only.

---

## 7. User Rights and Controls

As a participant, you have the right to:

- Revoke authorization at any time via TikTokâ€™s app settings  
- Request immediate deletion of all data collected through this app  
- Decline participation or opt out of experiments  
- Contact us for clarification or removal requests

We honor all such requests promptly and transparently.

---

## 8. TikTok Platform Integrity

Impactlytics is built to **respect and strengthen the TikTok platform** by:

- Complying fully with TikTokâ€™s API rate limits, scope limitations, and review standards  
- Avoiding spam-like behavior, algorithmic disruption, or exploitative content patterns  
- Contributing open research that may help TikTok enhance content moderation, user guidance, or algorithm transparency

TikTok reserves the right to suspend or disable this application at any time. We acknowledge and fully accept this authority.

---

## 9. Childrenâ€™s Data

This platform is not intended for users under the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect or process any data from minors.

---

## 10. Changes to This Policy

This policy may be updated as the research project evolves or if TikTokâ€™s API guidelines change. Any changes will be published with a new "Effective Date" and made publicly available.
