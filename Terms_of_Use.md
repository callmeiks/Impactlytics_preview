## 1. Introduction

Welcome to **Impactlytics**, a secure and ethical academic research platform developed as part of a graduate course at the University of Southern California. By accessing or using this application, you agree to comply with these Terms of Service ("Terms").

Impactlytics is designed for **non-commercial, research-oriented experimentation on TikTok**, supporting responsible platform usage, data transparency, and user protection. This app is fully aligned with TikTok‚Äôs Developer Terms and is intended to generate insights beneficial to both TikTok users and the platform itself.

---

## 2. Purpose and Value to TikTok Ecosystem

The goal of Impactlytics is to conduct structured academic research on content dynamics‚Äîsuch as how post timing, caption sentiment, and hashtag use affect engagement. This helps:

- **Creators** better understand content strategy using scientifically validated methods  
- **TikTok** benefit from academically rigorous findings on what drives healthy engagement  
- **Researchers** contribute transparent, reproducible insights to digital media studies

Impactlytics adheres to all usage limitations set forth by TikTok‚Äôs API policies and imposes strict internal controls to ensure appropriate use.


### 2.1 Internal Use Restriction

Impactlytics is intended strictly for **internal educational use** within the University of Southern California. Only pre-authorized members of the official student research team or authorized students may:

- Access the platform  
- Access the tiktok developer API credential
- Connect TikTok accounts  
- Run experiments or upload content  
- View and analyze data

The app is not public-facing, not available for commercial release, and will not be distributed beyond the scope of this academic project.

---

## 3. TikTok API Integration

Impactlytics uses TikTok APIs in limited and pre-approved scopes:

### 3.1 Login Kit (`user.info.basic`)

Purpose:
- Authenticate users securely via OAuth 2.0
- Retrieve limited public metadata such as:
  - Display name
  - Region
  - Follower count

This information is used solely for:
- Grouping users into anonymized experimental cohorts
- Enabling fair and balanced analysis of content impact across user segments

No private or sensitive information is accessed, stored, or shared.

### 3.2 Content Posting API (`video.upload`)

Purpose:
- Post user-approved short-form videos generated for research experiments
- Implement randomized controlled trials on TikTok (e.g., changing only the caption sentiment)
- Collect public performance metrics (e.g., views, likes, shares)

Every video posted:
- Is fully visible to the user before upload
- Does not contain any ads, monetization attempts, or unauthorized brand content
- Complies with TikTok‚Äôs Community Guidelines and API Posting Policy

---

## 4. User Consent

By logging in with TikTok, you:
- Voluntarily consent to participate in a supervised academic research study (under university supervision)
- Approve each video before it is posted to your account
- Help contribute to ethical, open research that can benefit TikTok‚Äôs ecosystem and content creator community

---

## 5. Data Handling and Privacy Protections

We take data privacy seriously. All data handling practices are designed to protect TikTok users and comply with academic and platform ethics:

- ‚úÖ No personal identifiers (e.g., email, phone, location) are collected  
- ‚úÖ No private messages, comments, or monetization data are accessed  
- ‚úÖ Data is anonymized before analysis  
- ‚úÖ All information is used only in aggregate for statistical modeling  
- ‚úÖ All TikTok authentication is handled via OAuth 2.0 (no credentials stored)

Data is retained only until the conclusion of the research project (July 2025), after which it is securely deleted.

---

## 6. Intellectual Property

Users retain full ownership of all TikTok content, including any videos posted via Impactlytics. The platform does not store, monetize, redistribute, or claim any rights over user-generated content.

All content posted is:
- Created for educational experimentation only
- Reviewed and approved by the user before posting
- Fully compliant with TikTok‚Äôs Community Guidelines and platform integrity policies

### Important Note:
- If a test-generated video happens to receive high engagement or go unexpectedly viral, **Impactlytics will not engage in any monetization, commercialization, sponsorship, or influencer activity related to that content**. The project team will treat such events strictly as academic anomalies and continue to respect full ownership by the user and platform governance by TikTok.

- No member of the research team will attempt to benefit‚Äîfinancially or reputationally‚Äîfrom the performance of posted content. This project is purely academic, non-profit, and temporary in scope.
- **All TikTok accounts connected to Impactlytics must be standard user accounts**, not **commercial**, **business**, or **creator marketplace** accounts. Impactlytics will not access or post:
  - Sponsored videos
  - Brand deals or influencer content
  - Product promotions
  - Affiliate links or e-commerce posts
- Impactlytics enforces a strict **content integrity policy**. All videos posted through this platform must adhere to TikTok‚Äôs Community Guidelines and will **never** include:
  - Violence, abuse, or threats
  - Hate speech, discrimination, or harassment
  - Misinformation or misleading health claims
  - Political propaganda or electoral messaging
  - Adult content or sexually explicit material
  - Any content deemed harmful or unsafe to TikTok users

This ensures TikTok‚Äôs platform remains free from research-driven commercial interference and guarantees Impactlytics is used exclusively in a non-commercial academic setting.

---

## 7. Responsible Research and TikTok Policy Compliance

Impactlytics is committed to:
- **Non-commercial use** only
- Strict adherence to TikTok's [Developer Terms of Service](https://developers.tiktok.com/terms/)
- Respecting all [TikTok Community Guidelines](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines)
- Limiting posting frequency and content volume to non-intrusive academic experiments

All experiments are designed to minimally impact the platform environment, while helping advance platform research and improve content understanding.

---

## 8. Right to Withdraw

You may revoke TikTok access or request data deletion at any time by:
- Removing app access from your TikTok account settings
- Contacting the research team directly at [lexuanqi@usc.edu](mailto:lexuanqi@usc.eduu)

Withdrawal will result in immediate termination of all data collection and posting privileges.

---

## 9. Limitation of Liability

This platform is provided ‚Äúas-is‚Äù for educational use. We do not guarantee:
- Posting success under future TikTok API changes
- Performance outcomes of any posted content
- Compatibility with future TikTok features

Neither the research team nor the University of Southern California shall be held liable for indirect or incidental damages arising from app usage.

## 10. Termination

We reserve the right to suspend or terminate platform access:

## 11. Amendments

We may update this document to reflect changes in academic scope or TikTok API policies. The most current version will always be accessible at the designated Terms of Service URL.

---

## 12. API Usage Controls

To ensure compliance with TikTok's Developer Platform policies and to prevent abuse or misuse of the API, **Impactlytics implements strict usage controls**:

- **Login Rate Limiting**: The number of TikTok login authentication requests is capped per 24-hour period to ensure stability and prevent token abuse.
- **Content Posting Limits**: The number of videos posted via the TikTok Content Posting API is restricted daily to minimize platform disruption and preserve feed integrity.
- **Experiment Throttling**: Experiments are conducted at a small scale, with randomized scheduling across a limited user pool to prevent any single trend or topic from being unintentionally amplified.

These safeguards protect the TikTok platform, reduce system load, and ensure that all academic use remains lightweight, ethical, and respectful of TikTok‚Äôs infrastructure.

Impactlytics reserves the right to pause or delay activity if usage thresholds are met before the daily reset.
